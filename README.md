This Github contains XML Annotation aspects created from Gene Ontology data for direct import into Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) software. 
In addition, a custom FASTA database has been created using data from Van Kelly et al., 2021 (https://www.mcponline.org/article/S1535-9476(21)00141-9/fulltext) 

This FASTA database divides the 119 proteins identified as cell cycle status signatures into 5 main clusters as identified by the exhaustive analysis by Van Kelly et al., 
By analyzing the expression of these proteins in single human cells it is possible to estimate the stage in the cell cycle for each individual cell. This work will be detailed by Orsburn and Bumpus, 2021.
